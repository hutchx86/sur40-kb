# SUR40 Knowledge Base & Wiki
All the information and pictures we've gathered on the SUR40 platform. 


This repository aims to describe and document the SUR40 platform. 

Additionally, the team behind this aims to create a drop in replacement board for the internal computer.
This board will NOT be a full PC, instead it will simply take USB and Video in, and connect it to the Visual Input processor board, fixing some of the quirks caused by the proprietary implementation of HDMI (no Audio for example, as the SUR40 PC routes a Digital SPDIF signal over the HDMI CEC pin to the HDMI in port on the VIP Board). It will also restore functionality such as enabling the two fans that will be disconnected once you remove the internal PC.

We also want to add some nice to have features, for example a Type-C input that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, providing a one cable solution to hook the SUR40 UP to a USB Host and Video source. 

This board is named the SUR40 IOCB, which stands for SUR40 Input/Output and Control Board.
